# JKBMS

A component to monitor and control a Jikong Battery Management System (JK-BMS) via BLE
Only the JK_B2A8S20P is tested.

I could not find an easy way to control the bms. The phone app is really frustrating to work with. Specially if you have multiple BMS devices.
In this simple tool you can pair multiple devices and quickly connect. 
It can display values and you can change values. Values can be set via console prompt bm.getActiveBattery().setMaxChargeCurrent(50)
Not all change values can be written yet. WIP
